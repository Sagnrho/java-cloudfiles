java-cloudfiles
===============

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The java-cloudfiles bindings are no longer being maintained and their
use is deprecated. They will not be available after August 1, 2013.

We recommend that you use the jclouds SDK; this supports
all of the Rackspace cloud products, and not just Cloud Files.

See http://docs.rackspace.com/sdks/guide/content/java.html to download or to contribute.




In order to build:

1)  Download the repository (which if you're doing this, you already have)
2)  type "ant compile" (or "ant package" if you'd like the full package)

In order to run unit tests

1) Edit the file src/test/resource/cloudfiles.properties, changing the 
   username and password as needed
2) run "ant test" to run the unit tests
3) run "ant test-report" if you'd like to create a handy-dandy html report 
   on the tests.
